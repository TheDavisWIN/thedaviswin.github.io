                Hello! My name is Davis. I am a student studying Computer Science at the 
                University of Texas at Dallas.
            </h1>
    
            <p>
                Before I had my first video game console, I spent a lot of time on the computer playing 
                browser games and watching YouTube videos. I remember teaching my parents how to 
                use the computer as well: how to turn it on and off, how to puruse the internet, 
                so on and so forth. Since then, I was the designated child of technology.
            </p>

            <p>
                My interest in the computer science field began when I was in high school. At that 
                time, I had taken my first computer science course where I learned the basics of 
                Java by making all sorts of games in an IDE called Greenfoot. It would inspire me to 
                develop my very first project, Pong. Ever since then, I dedicated my time to learning 
                various programming languages. These are the ones I'm familiar with:

                <li>Java</li>
                <li>C++</li>
                <li>C</li>
                <li>HTML</li>
                <li>CSS</li>
                <li>TypeScript</li>
            </ul>
